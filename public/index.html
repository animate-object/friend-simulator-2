      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      ><span slot="more-info">
        I'm building a game about friendship. Meet unique (procedurally
        generated) humans, and befriend them through the power of listening
        comprehension.
        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />
        The latest update connects the friend backend, which generates a 'world'
        of entities for each pageload, as well as connections between those
        entities. This world represents the body of knowledge unique to each
        friend. In the future, the friends will express more complex thoughts,
        and know more about their relation to the world.
        <br />
        <br />
        Additionally, this changeset adds a color hashing algorithm which colors
        each unique noun phrase. It really makes them 'pop'.
